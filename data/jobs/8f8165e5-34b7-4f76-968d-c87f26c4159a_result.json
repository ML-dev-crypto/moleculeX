  "query": "Which respiratory diseases show low competition but high patient burden in India?",
  "status": "completed",
  "executive_summary": "India faces significant unmet needs in respiratory diseases with high patient burden, as evidenced by limited clinical trial activity and patent filings. While the competitive landscape remains undefined due to a lack of direct data, the absence of trials and patents suggests potentially low competition, presenting a considerable opportunity for pharmaceutical companies. Further investigation is crucial to fully assess market dynamics and exploit the potential for novel respiratory therapies tailored to the Indian population.",
