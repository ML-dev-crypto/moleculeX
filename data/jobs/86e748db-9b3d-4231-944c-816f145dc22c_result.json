  "status": "completed",
  "executive_summary": "Despite a high patient burden in India for specific respiratory diseases, our analysis reveals a potential opportunity due to a lack of active clinical trials and limited scientific publications in the region. While the competitive landscape remains unclear with only a few related patents identified, the absence of ongoing research suggests an underserved market. Further investigation is warranted to determine the specific respiratory diseases driving this burden and the viability of developing targeted therapies.",
