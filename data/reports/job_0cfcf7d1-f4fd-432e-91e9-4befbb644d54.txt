Query: Which respiratory diseases show low competition but high patient burden in India?
Generated: 2025-11-09T09:44:01.419170

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on limited data, specific respiratory diseases in India present a potential opportunity due to an absence of active clinical trials and a low number of scientific publications suggesting untapped market potential. While the competitive landscape remains unclear, the existence of relevant patents, including those for tuberculosis treatment and EGFR inhibitors, indicates some research and development activity. Further investigation is crucial to identify specific high-burden respiratory conditions with minimal competition to inform strategic investment decisions and address unmet patient needs in India.
